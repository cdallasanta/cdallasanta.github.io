At index 0, of course.

### The Spark
At my last position, I was given the task of putting over 60 page breaks in an Excel spreadsheet. It took hours, and the entire time, I was thinking, "There has to be a better way." The next week, they asked me to do it again. Halfway through, I leared how to keybind pagebreaks to a shortcut, but knew there was a better way out there. When they asked me a third time, I instead went and started teaching myself Visual Basic. Two hours later, I had written a macro that could accomplish the multi-hour task in seconds. The process of learning a new skill, puzzling through the logic, and then delighting in the time saved is what paved the road several years later for me deciding to head into this field.

### It Spreads
In my current position, I inherited a paper-based collection of documents keeping track of our large challenge course's equipment, training records, facilitation hours, and more. In horror, I quickly moved it all into an Excel spreadsheet. One of the many issues of the previous system was relying on our staff to do some quick math by hand, which inevitably caused some enourmous errors. Excel came to the rescue and kept track of the math for our staff, but I knew it could be better. This past summer, I dove back in to learning VBA to learn about userforms to create a front-end program for my staff, greatly simplifying the weekly task of inputting the data.

### The Fire Takes Over
When my partner and I learned that we would be having our first child this winter, it was a prompt to take a good, careful look at our priorities. My current position as a Program Director for a YMCA camp, while a wonderful place to work, was not going to match well with a newborn. I needed a field with more consistent hours, where I could be home at a reasonable hour and have the chance of leaving work at home. Reflecting on past experiences that brought me a strong sense of engagement and accomplishment, I headed for the coding industry.

### When the Kindling Burns Out
I started learning Python through Datacamp on the advice of a friend who did a similar transition. After investing a few months heading down the Data Science path, I realized that visualizing data wasn't quite the right niche. On the advice of a few other friends and the internet, I started working on C#, but training resources weren't incredibly prevelant. I spent several days very stressed out about how to get to where I know I wanted to be. I fortunately stumbled upon Career Karma, an organization that pairs individuals looking to transition careers to great coding bootcamps. They connected me with several current students of several coding programs, which was a fantastic resource in helping chart my next year.

### A Steady Blaze
I blasted through Flatiron's bootcamp prep, along with Watch and Code's program, most of FreeCodeCamp, and several other tutorials, all the while reinforcing that not only am I good at this work, I greatly enjoy it. I greatly look foward to advancing my skills while in this program, and finding a career that utilizes this newly-discovered logic and problem-solving brain.
